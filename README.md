Fe–Y–O ZBL hybrid potential file (fe_y_o_zbl0904.table) derived from the pairwise interaction model of Hammond et al., J. Phys. Condens. Matter 25 (2013) 055402.
It enables molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steels, allowing investigation of:

Dislocation–oxide interactions and Orowan looping
Strengthening mechanisms due to oxide size/orientation
Defect trapping and radiation tolerance
Stability of Y₂O₃ particles in Fe under thermal and mechanical loading
The potential has been validated for Fe–Y₂O₃ nanocomposites and can be used in LAMMPS with pair_style table.

Here we have intial structure models by taking Fe BCC orientation (edge dislocation with b = a/2[111] in the (110) slip plane, axes set as [111], [–1-12], [1-10]), oxide sizes (2–6 nm), relaxation at 300 K, rigid top/bottom slabs with a mobile middle section, and shear speeds ~0.001/0.01/0.05 nm ps⁻¹ with stress–strain outpu
